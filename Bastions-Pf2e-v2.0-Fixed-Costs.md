# Bastions - Pathfinder 2e Remastered (v2.0 Complete - Fixed Costs)

If you include Bastions in your campaign, characters gain access to them at 5th level. You and the players can decide together how each Bastion comes into being. A character might inherit land, be granted a parcel to develop, or take over an existing structure and renovate it.

It's reasonable to assume that preparations have been happening in the background during a character's early adventures, so the Bastion is ready by the time they reach 5th level.

The design and purpose of a Bastion are entirely up to the player. A Wizard or Magus might build a tower, a Cleric or Oracle could establish a shrine, and a Fighter might create a fortified keep. A Rogue or Swashbuckler might set up a guildhall or private lodge. Other classes can use any of these options or mix elements to suit their character. For instance, a Champion might have a shrine like a Cleric's, but with the defenses of a Fighter's stronghold.

Players can also combine their Bastions to form a larger shared structure, if it fits the story and their goals.

## Bonus & Stacking Legend
- **Item bonus:** from facilities/tools. Stacks with status/circumstance, not with other item bonuses.
- **Status bonus:** from spells/stances. Rarely stacks with other status bonuses.
- **Circumstance bonus:** from environment/training. If multiple apply, use only the highest.
- Facilities **never change a character's proficiency** unless explicitly noted by a class/feat.

## Gaining a Bastion

If you include Bastions in your campaign, characters gain access to them at 5th level. You and the players can decide together how each Bastion comes into being. A character might inherit land, be granted a parcel to develop, or take over an existing structure and renovate it.

It's reasonable to assume that preparations have been happening in the background during a character's early adventures, so the Bastion is ready by the time they reach 5th level.

The design and purpose of a Bastion are entirely up to the player. A Wizard or Magus might build a tower, a Cleric or Oracle could establish a shrine, and a Fighter might create a fortified keep. A Rogue or Swashbuckler might set up a guildhall or private lodge. Other classes can use any of these options or mix elements to suit their character. For instance, a Champion might have a shrine like a Cleric's, but with the defenses of a Fighter's stronghold.

Players can also combine their Bastions to form a larger shared structure, if it fits the story and their goals.

## Initial Setup

At 5th level, you gain:
- **2 basic facilities for free** (one Cramped, one Roomy)
- **2 special facilities of your choice for free** (your choice of size)
- You begin with 0 Bastion Defenders and must recruit them through appropriate facilities

You can purchase additional facilities at any time using the standard facility costs.

## Fall of a Bastion

A character can lose their Bastion in the following ways:

- **Divestiture**: A character can give up their Bastion anytime, releasing hirelings and abandoning the location. The divested Bastion is quickly vacated and eventually looted.
- **Neglect**: If a character issues no orders to their Bastion for consecutive Bastion turns equal to the character's level, hirelings abandon it and the site is eventually looted. The character can later start a new Bastion, perhaps amid the ruins.
- **Ruination**: Drawing the Ruin card from a Deck of Many Things instantly destroys the Bastion. The player decides what terrible fate befalls it.

Regardless of how a Bastion falls, use the Facility Acquisition & Upgrades rules to determine how many special facilities come with a replacement Bastion.

## Combining Bastions

Two or more characters can combine their Bastions into a single structure. This doesn't change the number of special facilities each Bastion can have, how those facilities work, or who issues orders to each Bastion. Each Bastion retains its own hirelings, which can't be sent to or shared with another Bastion.

- **Shared Resources**: Combined Bastions share basic facilities and defenders only. Special facilities, companions, and orders remain separate to each character's Bastion. Companions cannot work across combined Bastions.
- **Shared Defenders**: If some event would cause one character's Bastion to lose defenders, another character can apply all or some of those losses to their Bastion instead, provided the Bastions are combined.
- **Joint Construction**: Combined Bastions can share basic facilities like dining rooms, courtyards, and defensive walls. The costs are split among participating characters as agreed upon.
- **Income caps and Bastion Boon limits are per character**, not per site, unless the GM rules a shared estate functions as one facility.

## Bastion Construction

### Defensive Walls

Standard defensive walls stand 20 feet high and can include an optional walkway along the top for patrols.

- **Cost**: 20 gp per 5-foot section (add 5 gp for a walkway)
- **Time**: 5 days per 50-foot length
- **Benefit**: If your Bastion is completely enclosed by defensive walls and comes under attack, reduce by 2 the number of dice rolled to determine how many Bastion Defenders are lost (minimum 2 dice).

### Facility Construction Rules

- **Unique Facilities**: The following facilities are Unique and limited to one per Bastion: Teleportation Circle, Demiplane, Reliquary. All other facilities may be duplicated, provided each serves a distinct purpose (e.g., multiple Gardens producing different outputs like Food and Poison). The GM has final say on narrative appropriateness.
- **Space Flexibility**: Squares may be arranged freely across multiple stories.
- **Corridors and Access**: Corridors, ramps, and stairs count toward the facility's square total.
- **Doors and Features**: Doors, windows, closets, and washrooms are included at no extra cost.
- **Defensive Integration**: Facilities can connect to or be built into defensive walls.

## Economic Framework

### Construction & Upgrade Costs (Fixed Cost System)

The cost of any special facility is determined solely by its size. Facilities cost the same amount regardless of when you build them or your character's level. This represents a standardized investment in quality construction and specialized materials.

| Facility Space | Size (5-ft squares) | Cost (All Levels) |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Cramped        | 4                   | 300 gp            |
| Roomy          | 16                  | 800 gp            |
| Vast           | 36                  | 2,500 gp          |

**Example**: A Roomy Armory costs 800 gp whether you build it at level 5, 9, 13, or 17.

### Facility Construction Time

Special facilities take 1 Bastion turn to construct once you have paid the construction cost. You can build multiple facilities simultaneously. Facility upgrades happen instantly when you gain the appropriate level, requiring no additional construction time or gold beyond what you've already invested.

### Enlargement Costs

Facilities that can be enlarged require additional payment to expand from their base size. The cost to enlarge a facility is the difference between the larger size cost and the current size cost.

**Enlargement Cost Examples:**
- Cramped (300 gp) → Roomy (800 gp) = **500 gp**
- Roomy (800 gp) → Vast (2,500 gp) = **1,700 gp**
- Cramped (300 gp) → Vast (2,500 gp) = **2,200 gp**

Enlargement takes 1 Bastion turn to complete.

**Enlargement Benefits**: Enlarging a facility doubles its capacity: Archives gain +1 reference book slot, Gardens double their harvest output, Workshops gain 3 additional tool sets. If no specific benefit is listed, enlargement provides more impressive/comfortable space for roleplay purposes.

### Income Regulation

To preserve game balance, the total passive income a character can gain from all their Bastion facilities is capped per Bastion turn. This represents the limit of what the local economy and the character's influence can support.

**Max Passive Income per Bastion Turn**
- Levels 5–8: **50 gp**
- Levels 9–12: **100 gp**
- Levels 13–16: **150 gp**
- Levels 17+: **250 gp**

Event payments count toward the cap; purely story payments can bypass it at GM discretion.

All income from Trade orders across all facilities counts against this single per-turn cap. If multiple Trade orders complete in the same turn, sum their income. If the total exceeds the income cap, the player chooses which facilities' income to prioritize, up to the cap. Excess income can be converted into non-monetary benefits (e.g., +1 Diplomacy bonus for 1 week per 1 gp, as per GM discretion). GM Note: Income generated beyond this cap can be converted into non-monetary benefits, such as favors, temporary discounts with local merchants, or a bonus to Diplomacy checks to Gather Information in the region for a week.

All passive gp gained during a Bastion turn—including Bastion Event payments—counts toward the Income cap. The GM may allow story payments to bypass the cap at their discretion (favor, goods, or non-gp benefits).

## Core Mechanics

### Bastion Turns

As time passes in the campaign, players take Bastion turns to reflect the activity occurring in their Bastions, whether or not the characters are present. On a Bastion turn, a character can issue orders to the special facilities in their Bastion or issue the Maintain order to the entire Bastion. By default, a Bastion turn occurs every 7 days of in-game time. Characters can bank up to 2 unused Bastion Turns. For extended absences, after banking two turns, the Bastion is assumed to be under the Maintain order for each subsequent week, and no further turns are accrued until the character issues orders again. Auto-maintain turns do NOT generate additional banked turns. You remain at 2 banked maximum until returning to issue orders.

**Order Execution**: All orders take exactly 7 days to resolve and complete at the end of the Bastion turn. All orders consume a full Bastion turn (7 days) regardless of actual task duration. For tasks that take less than 7 days, the facility remains occupied for the remainder of the turn maintaining equipment and preparing for the next order. Orders execute whether you are present at your Bastion or not. Once you issue orders for a turn, they cannot be changed until your next Bastion turn. You may issue orders to any number of your facilities. Facilities without orders remain idle (no benefits, no complications).

**Event Triggers**: Banked turns (up to 2) do not count toward the '3+ turns absent' trigger for Bastion Events. If a character is absent for 1–2 turns without issuing orders, no events occur unless the GM deems a major campaign event warrants a roll. After 2 banked turns, auto-Maintain begins, and an event is rolled every 3rd turn of absence (e.g., turn 5, 8, etc.).

The GM chooses when Bastion turns occur based on the narrative flow of the campaign. A Bastion turn typically happens:
- When the party completes a major adventure or story arc
- After significant downtime for rest and recovery
- Between distinct narrative chapters of the campaign
- At narratively appropriate moments when the characters would naturally return home

When a Bastion turn begins, the GM tells the players that a Bastion turn is occurring. Each player then decides which orders their facilities will execute. The turn resolves all at once, with results available when the next adventure begins. The GM should aim for roughly one Bastion turn every 3-5 game sessions, though this can vary based on the campaign's pacing.

### Bastion Boons (Global Limit)
A character can benefit from only **one Bastion Boon at a time**. Each facility has **Charges** (1 at Basic, 2 at Advanced, 3 at Master). **Spend 1 Charge** to grant that facility's boon to a character. All Charges refresh when you **Maintain** or **critically succeed** on that facility's Order during a Bastion turn.

### Order Quick Reference
- **Maintain:** No roll. Refresh all **Charges**; remove **Damaged** from one facility.
- **Produce / Trade / Recruit / Research / Empower:** Roll the listed skill vs. facility DC (16/22/28/34 by tier). Apply Degrees of Success. **Critical success** also refreshes that facility's **Charges**.
- **Event:** Resolve per table. Casualties can **Damage** facilities; **Heroic Escape** may trigger for companions.

## Bastion Orders and Skill Checks

### Facility Checks

A facility check is any skill check made when issuing an order to a facility. When characters issue orders requiring skill checks, companion happiness modifiers and other bonuses apply to these checks.

### Order Skills

| Order                             | Primary Skill                          | Alternative Skills                           |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Craft Order                       | Crafting                               | Appropriate Lore                             |
| Empower Order                     | Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion | Appropriate Lore                             |
| Harvest Order                     | Nature                                 | Agriculture Lore, Herbalism Lore, or similar |
| Recruit Order                     | Society                                | Warfare Lore or other relevant Lore          |
| Research Order                    | Society                                | Any suitable Lore                            |
| Trade Order                       | Society                                | Mercantile Lore or facility-specific Lore    |
| Scout Region                      | Society or Survival                    | Appropriate Lore                             |

**Order Skill Requirements**: The character issuing orders must make the required skill check using either the primary skill or one of the alternative skills listed. If the character is untrained in all listed skills for an order, they cannot issue that order to the facility.

### Bastion Orders

During each Bastion turn, you decide what orders your Bastion's facilities will carry out. Each special facility can attempt one order per turn. Orders fall into several categories:

#### Standard Orders (Available to All Facilities)
These orders can be executed at any special facility that has hirelings:

- **Maintain**: Issue no specific order and simply maintain the facility. This order auto-succeeds with no roll required and causes a Bastion Event to occur. Choose this order if you want a chance for something interesting to happen or if you want to avoid risk.
- **Trade**: Your hirelings use the facility to Earn Income. Roll the listed skill check for the facility. On a success, earn the standard income for your level (see Earn Income DC and Income Tables). On a critical success, earn double income. On a failure, earn half income. On a critical failure, earn nothing.

#### Facility-Specific Orders
Many facilities have special orders unique to their function. These are detailed in each facility's description and may include:

**Craft Order**: Use Crafting or an appropriate Lore skill to create items with facilities like the Arcane Study, Smithy, or Workshop.

**Empower Order**: Activate a facility's temporary benefit, often without a check. When one is required, use the tradition skill (Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion) or a relevant Lore.

**Harvest Order**: Gather resources from facilities such as the Garden or Greenhouse using Nature or a related Lore skill.

**Recruit Order**: Bring new defenders, creatures, or specialists to your Bastion with Society or a suitable Lore, as seen in facilities like the Barrack or Menagerie.

**Research Order**: Uncover information through facilities like the Library or Archive using Society or any relevant Lore.

**Scout Region**: Attempt Society or Survival vs. your facility tier DC to gather intel on a chosen nearby region/route/landmark. On a success, you gain one accurate intel; critical success grants two and often a map/secondary lead; failure yields vague info; critical failure returns false intel or triggers a rescue hook.

### DC by Facility Tier

| Facility Tier | Level | DC  |
| ------------- | ----- | --- |
| Basic         | 5     | 16  |
| Advanced      | 9     | 22  |
| Enhanced      | 13    | 28  |
| Master        | 17    | 34  |

### Degrees of Success

- **Critical Success**: You complete the order exceptionally, gaining any listed benefits plus an additional boon at the GM's discretion. **Critical success also refreshes that facility's Charges.**
- **Success**: You accomplish the order as intended.
- **Failure**: The order produces no results.
- **Critical Failure**: The order fails and causes the facility to be **Damaged**.

### Facility DCs & Income

All special facilities have a difficulty class (DC) based on their tier. When an order requires a check, compare the result to this DC:

| Tier     | Facility DC | Trade Income (Success) |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Basic    | 16          | Task level 1           |
| Advanced | 22          | Task level 5           |
| Enhanced | 28          | Task level 9           |
| Master   | 34          | Task level 13          |

**Earn Income**: Characters use the standard Earn Income rules from Pathfinder 2e, using the Task Level shown above to determine income for a successful Trade order. Reference the Earn Income table in the Core Rulebook for exact amounts based on character level and degree of success. Trade income is generated by hirelings and doesn't require the character's presence.

### Hireling Aid

Hirelings assigned to a facility can attempt to Aid checks for orders such as the Craft Order or Trade Order. They use the same skill as the order. On a successful Aid check, the hireling grants a +1 circumstance bonus (+2 on a critical success); on a critical failure, you take a –1 penalty.

**The Aid Check**: When an Order is given, the Hireling makes a check to see how helpful they are.

**The Skill**: The GM determines the appropriate skill for your check. It's often the same as the Order's listed skill.

**The DC**: The standard DC for an Aid check is 20. The GM can adjust this DC based on the circumstances, but 20 is the default.

**Hireling Aid Mechanics**: Each facility's hirelings can only attempt to Aid orders issued to that specific facility. Only one hireling per facility can provide Aid per order. Hirelings have a total modifier of +7 at Basic tier (+2 Expert proficiency, +5 from level), +11 at Advanced (+2 Expert, +9 level), +15 at Enhanced, and +19 at Master.

### Stacking Effects

Apply modifiers in this order: 1) Base value, 2) Flat additions/subtractions, 3) Multipliers/percentages, 4) Hireling Aid bonuses, 5) Companion bonuses, 6) Circumstance bonuses.

### Facility Crafting Rules

When using a Bastion facility to Craft, the following unified rules apply:

- **Material Costs**: Pay 50% of the item's Price in raw materials upfront.
- **Time Requirements**: Crafting takes 1 Bastion turn for items up to your level, 2 turns for items above your level.
- **Facility Benefits**: Facilities provide item bonuses to relevant Crafting skills and include all necessary tools and workspace.
- **Hireling Assistance**: The facility's hirelings can use the Aid action on your Crafting checks.

### Facility Acquisition & Upgrades

Characters gain new facilities and facility upgrades at specific level milestones:

| Character Level | New Facilities or Upgrades                                                                                  |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5               | Start with 2 basic facilities (one Cramped, one Roomy) + 2 special facilities of your choice (all free)    |
| 7               | All facilities advance to Advanced tier                                                                     |
| 9               | Gain 1 new special facility (pay standard cost)                                                             |
| 11              | All facilities advance to Enhanced tier                                                                     |
| 13              | Gain 1 new special facility (pay standard cost)                                                             |
| 15              | All facilities advance to Master tier                                                                       |
| 17              | Gain 1 new special facility (pay standard cost)                                                             |

When your facilities automatically advance to a new tier, they gain improved benefits and higher DCs immediately. The physical transformation happens narratively between adventures. You don't need to pay for tier upgrades—only for new facilities.

### Hirelings & Companions

**Hirelings** are the skilled workers who staff your facilities. Each special facility requires hirelings to function. Hirelings are abstracted and don't require individual stat blocks or management. If a facility loses its hirelings (through events or attacks), new hirelings automatically arrive at the start of the next Bastion turn, and the facility can issue orders again.

**Companions** are specific NPCs with personalities, stat blocks, and special bonds with the characters. They provide enhanced facility benefits but require occasional quests to maintain their happiness. Companions are recruited through specific facility orders and are detailed in the facility descriptions.

**Heroic Escape.** Companions aren't slain by Bastion Events. When they would be killed, they instead **escape**: they become **Unavailable for 1 Bastion turn**, and their associated facility becomes **Damaged**.

## Basic Facilities

A character's Bastion starts with two free basic facilities, chosen from the list below (one Cramped, one Roomy). A basic facility comes with nonmagical furnishings and can be enlarged by spending money and time. Basic facilities can be built as Cramped (4 squares), Roomy (16 squares), or Vast (36 squares).

Each Basic facility grants **one of the following (choose when built):**
- **One reroll per session** on a **non-attack/defense/initiative** check tied to the room's function, **or**
- A **+1 circumstance bonus** to a narrowly defined category of Bastion-related checks (GM approved) made **in this facility**.

### Basic Facility Descriptions

- **Bedroom**: A private chamber for rest and recuperation. A Cramped bedroom might be a simple cot and a chest, while a Vast suite could include a four-poster bed, a fireplace, and a balcony. Multiple bedrooms can be built to house guests or allies.
- **Dining Room**: A space for taking meals. This can range from a modest table for a few trusted companions to a grand hall capable of hosting feasts for local dignitaries.
- **Parlor**: A comfortable room for receiving guests, holding informal meetings, or relaxing. It is typically furnished with chairs, couches, and small tables. A larger parlor might serve as a common room for the Bastion's inhabitants.
- **Courtyard**: An open-air space within the Bastion's walls. It can be a simple dirt yard for training, a decorative garden for quiet contemplation, or a paved area for assembling troops.
- **Kitchen**: A facility for preparing food, equipped with a hearth or stove, worktables, and pantries. A larger kitchen is necessary to support a large number of defenders or to host feasts.
- **Storage**: A secure room, cellar, or warehouse for keeping supplies, equipment, and non-perishable goods safe from the elements and casual theft.

## Bastion Events

When the Maintain order is issued, roll d100 on the following table. Besides Maintain orders, roll for events when: returning after 3+ turns absent, major campaign events occur, or a facility critically fails an order (GM discretion).

| d100  | Event                     |
| ----- | ------------------------- |
| 01-50 | All Is Well               |
| 51-55 | Attack                    |
| 56-58 | Criminal Hireling         |
| 59-63 | Extraordinary Opportunity |
| 64-72 | Friendly Visitors         |
| 73-76 | Guest                     |
| 77-79 | Lost Hirelings            |
| 80-83 | Magical Discovery         |
| 84-91 | Refugees                  |
| 92-98 | Request for Aid           |
| 99-00 | Treasure                  |

### Event Descriptions

#### All Is Well
Nothing significant happens. The GM can add minor flavor, like a leaky roof being fixed or a hireling adopting a stray dog.

#### Attack
A hostile force attacks but is defeated. Roll 6d6; for each 1, one Bastion Defender dies. If the Bastion has zero defenders, a random special facility (determined by the GM rolling 1d[number of special facilities] or using any fair random method) is **Damaged** and unusable for one Bastion Turn. If no special facilities exist, a random basic facility is damaged instead, losing its reroll benefit for one turn. If no facilities are damaged (e.g., a new Bastion with no orders issued), the Attack has no mechanical effect but may have narrative consequences at the GM's discretion.

**Damaged Condition**: A Damaged facility cannot be used for orders until repaired. Issuing a Maintain order to your entire Bastion removes Damaged from one facility of your choice.

#### Criminal Hireling
An official arrives with a warrant for a hireling. You can pay a bribe, as determined by the Event Cost/Payment Scale table (use the **Event Cost/Payment Scale** table), to retain them; otherwise they are arrested and the facility is without staff for one turn. If unable to pay: the hireling is arrested.

#### Extraordinary Opportunity
Your Bastion can host an important event. Seizing the opportunity provides a tangible benefit (like a second roll on the event table, rerolling this result) but comes at a cost, as determined by the Event Cost/Payment Scale table (use the **Event Cost/Payment Scale** table). If unable to pay: opportunity declined without penalty.

#### Friendly Visitors
Visitors pay to use one of your facilities for a short time. This does not interrupt your own orders. You gain a payment, as determined by the Event Cost/Payment Scale table (use the **Event Cost/Payment Scale** table).

#### Guest
A friendly guest stays at your Bastion, providing a small boon (a gift, a temporary defender, a monster's aid in one attack, or a letter of recommendation).

#### Lost Hirelings
A random special facility (determined by the GM rolling 1d[number of special facilities] or using any fair random method) loses its hirelings. Per the standard replacement rule, the facility is non-functional for this Bastion Turn, and new hirelings arrive at the start of the next turn.

#### Magical Discovery
Your hirelings discover or create an uncommon magic potion or scroll at no cost to you.

#### Refugees
A group of 2d4 refugees seeks shelter, offering a payment for your protection, as determined by the Event Cost/Payment Scale table (use the **Event Cost/Payment Scale** table).

#### Request for Aid
A local leader requests aid. Send one or more Bastion Defenders. Roll 1d6 per defender sent. On a total of 10+, the problem is solved and you earn a reward, as determined by the Event Cost/Payment Scale table (use the **Event Cost/Payment Scale** table). Below 10, the reward is halved and one of your Bastion Defenders is killed.

#### Treasure
Your Bastion acquires a random art object or magic item of its tier level. The GM determines the item, potentially using the treasure generation tables from the Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide.

### Event Cost/Payment Scale

| Character Level | Tier     | Scaled Gold Value |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| 5–8             | Basic    | 1d6 × 10 gp       |
| 9–12            | Advanced | 1d6 × 25 gp       |
| 13–16           | Enhanced | 1d6 × 50 gp       |
| 17+             | Master   | 1d6 × 100 gp      |

### Cannot Pay Consequences

If unable to pay required event costs:
- **Criminal Hireling**: Hireling is arrested
- **Extraordinary Opportunity**: Declined without penalty
- **Defensive events**: Deal maximum damage when payment required

## Multiple Bastions in Party

Each Bastion operates independently unless formally combined. Characters can visit but not issue orders to other Bastions. Aid Another actions are allowed for facility checks if physically present. When multiple characters have Bastions, they can coordinate activities but maintain separate economies and defender pools unless formally combined.

## Appendix: Turn Resolution Checklist

1. **Beginning of Turn**
   - Check for Progression: Did you level up? If so, apply automatic facility tier scaling and make your new facility or upgrade choice.
   - Hireling Replacement: Did you lose any hirelings last turn? They are now replaced, and their facility is active again.
   - Companions: Have you been given any companion quests that are not completed? Adjust their facility bonuses based upon their happiness.
   - Apply Ongoing Effects: Check for any boons or temporary effects from the previous turn that are still active.

2. **Choose Orders**
   - Option A: Active Management. For each of your special facilities, choose one order (Craft, Empower, Harvest, Recruit, Research, Trade, or a facility-specific order like Scout).
   - Option B: Maintain Order. If you are absent, don't want to issue specific orders, or wish to trigger a random event, select this for the entire Bastion. Proceed to step 4.

3. **Active Management Resolution**
   - **Craft**: Announce the item being crafted. Pay 50% of the item's Price in raw materials. Crafting takes 1 Bastion turn for items up to your level, 2 turns for higher.
   - **Empower**: Note the temporary benefit you have gained and its duration (typically until the start of your next Bastion turn).
   - **Harvest**: Collect the resources or items produced by the facility and add them to your inventory.
   - **Recruit**: Add the new defenders, creatures, or hirelings to your Bastion's roster.
   - **Research / Scout**: Make the appropriate skill check against the facility DC. Record the information you gain from a success or critical success.
   - **Trade**: Make the appropriate skill check to Earn Income. Track the amount earned against your per-turn income cap.

4. **Maintain Order Resolution**
   - Roll for Event: The GM rolls d100 on the Bastion Events table.
   - Resolve Event: Follow the event's description. Pay any costs or receive any payments or boons. Update your Bastion Defender and hireling counts if necessary.

5. **End of Turn**
   - Resolve All Outcomes: Finalize the results from all orders and events.
   - Update Sheets: Update your reference sheets with any changes to facility status, hireling counts, income earned, and defender numbers.
   - Note for Next Turn: Write down any new ongoing effects, boons, or multi-turn projects that will carry over.
