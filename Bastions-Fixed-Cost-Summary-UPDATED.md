# Bastions v2.0 - Fixed Cost System Summary (Updated)

## What Changed

This version uses **Option 2: Moderate Fixed Costs** from the fixed-cost options guide.

**PLUS: 6 friction point fixes for smoother gameplay!**

### Simple Cost Table

| Facility Size | Cost (All Levels) |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Cramped       | 300 gp            |
| Roomy         | 800 gp            |
| Vast          | 2,500 gp          |

**That's it!** No multipliers, no tracking when you built something. A Roomy facility always costs 800 gp.

### Enlargement Costs

| Enlargement                | Cost    |
|----------------------------|---------|
| Cramped → Roomy            | 500 gp  |
| Roomy → Vast               | 1,700 gp|
| Cramped → Vast (skip tier) | 2,200 gp|

---

## Why These Numbers?

These costs are balanced for all level ranges:

**At Level 5:**
- 800 gp for a Roomy facility is significant (represents weeks of adventuring income)
- Makes early facility choices meaningful
- Still affordable with planning

**At Level 17:**
- 2,500 gp for a Vast facility is still noticeable
- Prevents trivial facility spam
- Maintains meaningful economic decisions

---

## Starting Facilities (Modified for Fixed Costs)

At 5th level, you gain:
- **2 basic facilities FREE** (one Cramped, one Roomy)
- **2 special facilities of your choice FREE** (any size you want)
- Begin with 0 Bastion Defenders

This generous starting setup ensures characters can establish their Bastion without depleting their starting wealth.

## NEW: Friction Fixes Included! ✨

This UPDATED version includes 6 quality-of-life improvements:

### 1. Trade Excess Conversion
**Fix:** Clear guidance at point-of-use about converting excess income to favors/influence
- No more "wasted" successful Trade orders
- Conversion rate built right into the Trade description

### 2. Banking Timeline Flowchart
**Fix:** Visual timeline showing exactly when events roll during extended absence
```
Turn 5: ROLL EVENT (3rd absent turn)
Turn 8: ROLL EVENT (6th absent turn)
```
- No more confusion about auto-Maintain events

### 3. Fortune Effect Clarity
**Fix:** Clear distinction between on-site bonuses and traveling boons
- Facility Benefits = on-site only
- Empower boons = travel with you

### 4. Defender Scaling Guidance
**Fix:** GM guidance for managing high defender counts
- Suggestions for increasing lethality
- Narrative uses for defenders (caravans, checkpoints)

### 5. Parallel Crafting Visibility
**Fix:** Surfaced the "craft 2 items at once" rule to main crafting section
- Vast facilities can craft simultaneously
- Now visible where players look for crafting rules

### 6. Trade Diversification Tip
**Fix:** Strategic guidance to prevent all-Trade turns
- Encourages mixing Recruit/Research/Empower/Harvest
- Prevents cap frustration before it happens

**See Friction-Fixes-Changelog.md for complete details on all changes.**

## Converting From Scaling System

If you started with the scaling cost system:

1. **Existing facilities keep their current tier** (no changes)
2. **Future facilities use fixed costs** (300/800/2,500 gp)
3. **No refunds or adjustments** needed for past construction

It's that simple!
